# Blue-Shift-NASA-Hackathon
The "Embiggen Your Eyes" challenge seeks a platform to explore NASA's vast image datasets, enabling zooming, labeling, and pattern discovery. Galactic Gateway offers a 2D Milky Way map, 3D Solar System/Earth views with orbits, search, image matching, and a Star Wars-inspired UI for intuitive cosmic exploration.
